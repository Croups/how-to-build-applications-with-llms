# Structured Outputs Tutorial: Getting Predictable Responses from LLMs

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on structured outputs with OpenAI. This tutorial will guide you through the essential features of structured outputs and how they can enhance your LLM integrations by providing reliable, consistent responses.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Introduction to Structured Outputs**
   - Basic OpenAI API calls
   - Issues with unstructured responses
   - Pydantic model integration
   - Using `.parse()` endpoint

2. **Field Features & Examples**
   - Simple data extraction (User information)
   - Working with enums and predefined categories
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Injection detection
   - Query generation
   - Complex data structures

3. **Practical Applications**
   - Blog article generation system
   - Multi-step content pipelines
   - User intent extraction
   - Transaction data parsing
   - Content formatting controls

## Why Structured Outputs?

Structured outputs allow you to:
- Enforce specific response formats
- Extract exactly the data you need without parsing
- Eliminate unpredictable responses
- Build more reliable applications
- Simplify your application logic
- Handle complex data structures with ease
- Avoid prompt injection vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of Python type hints
- Familiarity with Pydantic
